            <b>Objective:</b>The purpose of this project is to visualize the data facebook has released in its transperancy report.  This data includes information on how many government requests for private user data it receives, how many of these requests are filled, as well as how many times governments have limited citizen access to facebook.  The data is tied to each country and can be viewed for years 2013-2017 with more fields and higher granularity towards the more recent years.
