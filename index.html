            <b>Objective: </b>The purpose of this project is to visualize the data facebook has released in its transparency report.  The three products are included within this dataset are Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp since they are all owned by the Facebook parent company.  The data includes information on how many government requests for private user data it receives and fulfillment rates, information on content restrictions based on local law, as well as a limited amount of data on service disruptions and copyright infringement.  The specifics for each dataset are outlined below.
        <br>
            
        <p><b><center>Data Available with descriptions:</center></b><br>
        <b>Government Requests for user data :</b><br>
Years available: 2013-2017<br>
Indexed by: Country<br>
Description:  As part of our ongoing effort to share more information about the requests we have received from governments around the world, Facebook regularly produces this report on government requests for user data to provide information on the nature and extent of these requests and the strict policies and processes we have in place to handle them.<br><br>

<b>Content restrictions based on law:</b><br>
Years available: 2013-2017<br>
Indexed by: Country<br>
Description:  When something on Facebook or Instagram is reported to us as violating local law, but doesn't go against our Community Standards, we may restrict the content's availability in the country where it is alleged to be illegal. We receive reports from governments and courts, as well from non-government entities such as members of the Facebook community and NGOs. This report details instances where we limited access to content based on local law.<br><br>

<b>Service Disruptions:</b><br>
Years available: 2016-2017<br>
Indexed by: Country<br>
Description:  Internet disruptions are intentional restrictions on connectivity that limit people's ability to access the internet or specific websites and apps. Disruptions prevent people from sharing and communicating with their family and friends and create barriers for businesses. We regularly monitor the availability of our services worldwide, and report on identified, temporary internet disruptions that impact the availability of Facebook products. This report is not intended to be exhaustive.<br><br>

<b>Intellectual Property Infringement:</b> <br>
Years available: Only available for 2017 by month<br>
Indexed by: Product (either facebook, instagram) and type of infrigement<br>
Description:  We take IP rights seriously, and we aim to foster a safe and trusted community that encourages people to share content lawfully on Facebook and Instagram. We've put measures in place to help people protect their IP, including combatting copyright and trademark infringement and counterfeit goods. These include a global notice-and-takedown program, a robust repeat infringer policy, and additional specialized measures going beyond notice-and-takedown.In this report, we're releasing updated information on our IP practices, the volume and types of IP reports we receive from rights holders, and how much content those reports affect. Our goal in sharing this data is to encourage people to continue sharing and discovering content with confidence on Facebook and Instagram.<br><br>

            <b><p>Additional Information:</b>
            I would like to visualize this data on a heat map with a tooltip displaying relavent information when you mouseover each country.  On the bottom of a map will be a slide selector that will allow you to choose between data from years 2013-2017.  On the right side of the map I would like to have a linegraph visualizing the changes for each country between the data in years 2013 to 2017.  This linegraph would show data for whichever country the mouseover selects.  This data is relevant because you want to be able to visualize whether government requests for user data is increasing or decreasing by country
