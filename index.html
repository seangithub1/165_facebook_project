        <h1>Government Oversight on Social Media Access and Privacy</h1>

            <b>Objective: </b>The purpose of this project is to visualize the data facebook has released in its transperancy report.  This data includes information on how many government requests for private user data it receives, how many of these requests are filled, as well as how many times governments have limited citizen access to facebook.  The data is tied to each country and can be viewed for years 2013-2017 with more fields and higher granularity towards the more recent years.

        <b>Data Sources:</b></p>
        <ul><li><a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/">Facebook Data Explanation Page</a </li>
            <li><a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/government-data-requests">Facebook Data Download Website</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Relevant Visualization Sources</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/government-data-requests">Facebook's Own visualizations of tranparency data (scroll down)</a></li>
        </ul>
            
            <b><p>Additional Information:</b>
            I would like to visualize this data on a heat map with a tooltip displaying relavent information when you mouseover each country.  On the bottom of a map will be a slide selector that will allow you to choose between data from years 2013-2017.  On the right side of the map I would like to have a linegraph visualizing the changes for each country between the data in years 2013 to 2017.  This linegraph would show data for whichever country the mouseover selects.  This data is relevant because you want to be able to visualize whether government requests for user data is increasing or decreasing by country
